Hence, AUC DIFFERENCE can be used to tune the model parameter, which is 'C' in the case of Logistic Regression. The value of 'C' which gives minimum difference between TRAINING and TESTING AUC is selected because it's the one that generalizes well on new or unknown data. I have done parameter tuning for logistic regression with this logic and it gave me quite good improvement in the precision and recall of the model. However, the precision of neutral values seems quite less, but it can be considered as a part of trade-off because in this kind of problem, we often don't want to miss NEGATIVE reviews or CONSTRUCTIVE feedback from the customers. It's fine if a positive or neutral feedback is classified as NEGATIVE by our model. As a result, a precision rate of 95% for NEGATIVE is preferrable. BETTER ACCURACY FOR THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL CAN ALSO HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED BY RANDOMLY SAMPLING THE DATA. THE NEGATIVE DIFFERENCE IN THE AUC SCORES REFLECT THIS. \n",

The tuning of more advanced deep learning based models is a relatively difficult task and could have been done using more advanced methods like RandomizedSearchCV or GridSearchCV. But there are ample of ways and methods that can be used and invented for the purpose of this problem to improve its accuracy. \n",

However, I didn't want to give up and believed that my general Machine Learning knowledge and proficiency with Python and its libraries will help me to get through this. So I just had to familiarize with NLP data cleaning, augmentation, and processing techniques and standard and study NLP workflow of various projects. I did that using Kaggle, Medium, and TowardsDataScience article. Once I got an idea about basic NLP libraries, terminologies, and techniques, I had decided that I don't want to make the model too complex and had aimed to finish it and get some results by making it as simple and general as possible. Therefore, for the DATA EXPLORATION and PROCESSING, I only implemented as much was required and didn't go into more complex analysis (for example, flight-based analysis of reviews) and processing. Removing, mentions, emojis, stopwords, basic lemmatization, seemed really enough for me to extract meaningful ideas from the tweets. So I followed those basic instincts for the first two steps and prepared my TRAINING and TEST DATA!\n",

Because of the different airlines data given, it might be initially seem attractive to graph down and explore the data for specific airlines but according to me it was useless for this problem because our main aim is to learn the sentiments of the customers based on their tweets (regardless of the FLIGHT). So I excluded that from my model and proceeded with fairly simple exploration. Also, I was unsure about two features, so I tried to plot countplots to see what kind of values it contained. It made more sense but I was still unsure about how it's going to be useful for the problem statement so I decided to let it be there and address it towards the end.\n",

But, it was useful exploring and understanding the data in beginning because it helped me to get an idea about the 'sentiment labelling standards' used by the provider of the dataset. \n",
