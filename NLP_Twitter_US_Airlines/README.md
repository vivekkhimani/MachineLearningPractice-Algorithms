## Twitter US Airlines Sentiment Analysis

## Data Credits: 
- Kaggle
## Purpose: 
- This project was done as a technical assessment for an internship opportunity at Konigle, Singapore.Therefore, I hereby give complete credit to the company for sending in this assessment as an iPython notebook on Google colab and I haven't made any changes to the formatting of the assessment.
## Description: 
- A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service"). My job was to create a classifier using this data which can distinguish between NEGATIVE and NEUTRAL tweets. 
## Details: 
- All the details and most of my logic, can be found as comments and text boxes in my ipynb file so the readers are requested to read through the file. 
## Experience and Learning: 
- This was the first time I was working with the NLP data therefore the learning curve was really steep for me as I had to learn about everything from scratch including typical NLP project architecture, terminologies, processes, libraries, etc. However, as I didn't want to give up on the project, I trusted my existing Machine learning skills and knowledge and started reading a lot of online articles to learn about the NLP workflow and all the terms that I was unaware about. It was still really difficult to apply all those concepts to custom data but at the end I was able to complete it after a lot of working and editing. Despite no experience with NLP, I was able to complete this assessment in 2 days alongside my regular school (college) work and I am quite happy because of that. I would have definitely made some logical errors or would have used incorrect approaches due to lack of experience, but I will be happy to learn and improve upon those things in the future version of my project. 
## Classifier Information: 
- Please note that my main learning aim through this project was to get used to NLP workflow and data processing techniques and not emphasize much on what classifier would have worked the best. As a result, I have used simplest of all, the LOGISTIC REGRESSION for this project. To improve the performance, the future scope can be using other classifiers like deep neural networks, boosting methods, or recurrent nets. But that shouldn't be much challenging, as the main challenge is to analyze the raw data and process it in such a way that it can be fed to the classifiers.
