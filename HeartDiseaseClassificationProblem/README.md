# Heart Disease Classification Problem

# Purpose:
- This project was done to solve the DrivenData challenge which requires the participants to build a model that classifies on the basis of given data that if a person is suffering from Heart Disease or not. 

# Approach:
- Based on my intuition after looking at the data and understanding the problem, I built and tested Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and SGD classifiers to test the results. Extensive tuning and analysis had been performed on each model to get an accuracy upto 86% and precision upto 82% despite the limited data availability. 

# Completion Time:
- Also, this project was completed within a span of 24 hours. Other documents in the folder contains my research notes, data engineering, and reasons for disregarding some other models.

# Rank:
- DRIVENDATA CHALLENGE RANK - 180/3300 (FIRST SUBMISSION)
