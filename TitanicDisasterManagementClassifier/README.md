# Purpose:
- This is another challenge similar to HeartDiseasePrediction and it's posted on a Kaggle competition. It's a classification challenge based on the Titanic boat sinking incident. The description or the overview of the problem is as follows:

# Description:
- The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

# Approach and Details:
- My approach for classification - Various supervised learning algorithms can be used to solve this problem depending on the available features in the data. But as I had solved Heart Disease problem with various algorithms, I will demonstrate this problem using an Artificial Neural Network, which is another important component of Machine Learning. 

- Let's start!
