# MachineLearningPractice-Algorithms
I have created this repository to upload all the Machine Learning theory and algorithms that I will be learning and practicing. I have been doing this since a long time but thought of making a repository at present. As a result, I will also try to upload my old content, but I will be at least putting content from now on regularly.
